    <!-- Projected Approach
[A] One Character, 8 Characters, In console, No User Input
X1) Set variable for index of number characters (0-9)
X2) Random number generator
X3) Link RNG to reference index of variable
X4) Loop 8 times, concate all values

[B] Add User Input for Password Length
1) Change generator code to accept user input
2) Using prompt
3) Set limitations: Minimum 8, Maximum 128

[C] One Character -> Four Characters
1) Set up variables for arrays for all four types of characters
2) Clean up code with JavaScript objects/loops/function

[D] Print to Page
1) Look up how to print to page
2) Change console.log -> print to page

[E] Add skeleton CSS
1) Title
2) Instructions
3) Length of Password (8-128 Characters)
4) 4 Selectable Criteria Boxes for Character Type
5) Box that prints password in middle/center
6) Generate Password Button
7) Copy to Clipboard Button

[F] One Button User Input
1) When user clicks on button, script runs to generate password

[G] User Selectable Parameters
1) Add buttons to change which character types are generated
2) Ensure user needs to select at least one character before password can be generated.
3) Look into changing prompt -> user text box in page

[H] Copy to Clipboard
1) Add button to copy to Clipboard

[G] Tidy up -->
    <script>
      function rNGNumber() {
        var numCharArr = ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"];
        for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
          document.write(numCharArr[Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)]);
        }
      }
      rNGNumber();
    </script>
  </body>
